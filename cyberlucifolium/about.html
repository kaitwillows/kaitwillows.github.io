        <p>this is the first song of this little "challenge" i'm doing for myself, where i make and release one song per month for 12 months.</p>
        <p>i might be cheating a little bit with this first song, as i made it probably over a year ago, and it just lived as an .mp3 on my old phone for a while. every other song will be made as this year goes by.</p>
        <p>on the song itself, i don't have a lot to say. it has no lyrics, but as i was making it i thought of the title "cyberlucifolium breathing" as some sort of vague idea of a living plant powered by yellow gloey circuitry. </p>
        <p>as i was thinking about a cover art / visualizer, i thought about recreating porter robinson's squiggly style as a 3d rendering engine from scratch (as i'm thinking about it, the idea was verbatim just the start of the <a href="https://youtu.be/oKMNj8v2gKE?si=IhjUMvbT2vGcGaFt">dullscythe</a> video). except, i kinda wanted it to seem like the lines were "drawn" in real time by a little moving pixel. i got really lazy though and it doesn't really match what was in my head but eh whatever.</p>
        <p>also idk the colour scheme with the beige and grey (although it's not super obvious its grey) is kinda nice idk i like it yuh</p>
        <p>ALSO lmao sorry i will admit it's probably not produced/mixed/mastered well at all. i think i made it in like, a couple hours, definitely didn't mix it or anything, and it's the first song i ever "mastered" (which was just making sure it was loud enough)</p>
