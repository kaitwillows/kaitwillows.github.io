                <p>hello i'm kaitlyn, i'm a hobbyist music maker. here is some info about me and my music
                    that i think might be important:</p>
                <h1>omg how can i listen to your amazing music?</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>all my "official" releases can be found on (probably) any streaming
                        service under "kaitwillows."</li>
                    <li>all my music can all be found on my 
                        <a href="https://kaitwillows.bandcamp.com/">bandcamp page</a>.</li>
                    <li>visuals and most songs can be found on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@kaitwillows/">youtube channel</a>.</li>
                    <li>direct downloads of everything can be found on <a href="https://downloads.selfsynthesized.net">
                        here</a>. 
                        <ul><li>this includes .wav files, .mp3 files, demos, stems, and visuals when avalable.</li>
                        <li>note that this fileserver can go down from time to time. it's currently running off of
                            an old chromebook with a usb drive plugged into it and sometimes it just stops working :(
                        </li></ul>
