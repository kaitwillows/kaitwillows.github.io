            <p>
                for the longest time, i've wanted to make music, but i've struggled to make myself actually do it.
                ideas reguarding how to actually go about making music have shuffled around in my brain, like
                "treat it like a job," 
                "treat it like a passtime," 
                "practice it,"
                "be playful with it,"
                "take small steps,"
                "don't focus on the end goal,"
                "<i>do</i> focus about the end goal,"
                "learn to live imperfection,"
                "only release something you love,"
                etc, etc.
            </p>
            <p>recently though, advice from these two videos have been stuck in my mind:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/BXJ0-h-DHsc?si=Vgv4qjQbmtaSgUJI">
                    this one is about the necessity of deadlines; how setting them forces you to accomplish what you want to.
                </a></p></li>
                <li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/jGhobd9nGoU?si=wsyuzeyv6Pf_dpk4">
                    and this one is about how the feeling of inspiration follows action; for one, dont wait till you "feel like it" to take action,
                    but also know that that feeling of motivation will follow your actions.
                </a></p></li>
            </ul>

            <br><hr><br>

            <p>idk, the other thing is that recently i've been feeling at peace with the idea of not making music,
                like, i think i'd be fine if i just focused on other things. but then again, that video about how "the inspiration follows the action"
                makes me think that i should at least give music one last try before i give up on it. maybe i'll find something beautiful.
            </p>
            <!-- <p>kind of semi-related is a question of how ego plays into my motivation for making music, like i used to want to make music
                mostly so i could have something impressive to show others, but i'd like to think that now, the primary motivation is the music itself.
                the one question after that is "why does it have to be me to make the music," and idk maybe the answer that it's important to create
                things, instead of only consuming them <a href="https://youtu.be/6SSbROX3GxM?si=gOvx6GCwOSnspFh8">(PLEASE WATCH THIS VIDEO (only if you want though idk)).</a>
                idk more generally, it's important to have hobbies, or at the very least, i enjoy doing difficult things because they make me feel accomplished.
                ok but also i keep getting this idea that i want to make myself as cool as possible, not for anyone else but more so i can just be proud of myself.
                man idk ignore me yapping like bro why are you even reading this go scroll tiktok or something IGNORE ME UAGH.
            </p> -->
            <p>my plan atm is to make and release one song per month for twelve months, starting september 1st. (and maybe also include visials/mvs,
                maybe not because i'll be already kinda busy during the fall)</p>

            <br><hr><br>




            <p>for the first month, i have this old song called "cyberlucifolium" i made over a year ago, and lived as an mp3 on my phone for a while.</p>
            <div class="audioContainer">
                <audio controls>
                    <source src="https://downloads.selfsynthesized.net/unreleased/cyberlucifolium/cyberlucifolium%20%28master1%29.wav" type="audio/mp3">
                </audio>
            </div> 
            <p>in all honesty, i'm not sure if i really <i>love</i> the song, plus i've lost the project files and a lossless export, 
                but it's not terrible i think, and i gotta stick to those deadlines.</p>
            <p>also yeah, the thing at the top with the pixely flower (should it render correctly) is the cover art / visualizer i'm working on for this song.
                i made it in javascript so that it works in the web browser (bc i'm trying to get on that <a href="https://neocities.org/">indie web grind</a> if you couldnt tell).

            <p>for the month after, i'm probably gonna do this song, working title "pkvl":</p>
            <div class="audioContainer">
                <audio controls>
                    <source src="https://downloads.selfsynthesized.net/unreleased/pkvl/demos/pkvl%20demo%202.1.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
                </audio>
            </div> 
            <p>idk, this song probably gets more closly at some of the things i like about music. though i'll probably remake it and play around with sound design and shit.
                i want it to be like one of those songs that i feel blown away by on the first listen.
            </p>
            <p>i'm going to try to take porter robinson's advice on "making your own favorite song":
